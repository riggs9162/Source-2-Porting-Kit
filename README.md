# Source 2 Porting Kit

The **Source 2 Porting Kit** is a developer toolkit designed to simplify the process of porting assets and projects from Valve's Source 2 engine back to Source 1. It provides essential utilities for asset conversion, scripting, and performance optimization, making it easier to adapt projects to Source 1.

## Features

- **GUI Interface**: Provides a user-friendly interface for managing assets and configurations.
- **Texture Conversion**: Automatically converts PNGs into VTFs and VMTs, including support for provided normal maps.
- **Model Conversion**: Generates QC files with the given SMDs for models. Note that this is not intended for final releases, you will need to manually adjust surface properties, animations, and other details. The VMT shader type can be selected from *VertexLitGeneric*, *LightmappedGeneric*, or *UnlitGeneric*.
- **Config Saving**: Saves paths and settings in a configuration file for easy access and reuse.
- **Batch Processing**: Supports batch processing of multiple assets to streamline the porting workflow.

## Requirements

- **Python**: Ensure Python 3.13 or later is installed.
- **Source 1 SDK**: Required for testing and integration.
- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or later.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the Source 2 Viewer to port models and textures:
   - Download the Source 2 Viewer from "https://valveresourceformat.github.io/"
   - Export the models and textures you want to port from Source 2.

## Usage

1. Open Source 2 Viewer and export the models and textures you want to port.
2. Place the exported files in the appropriate directories within the Source 2 Porting Kit.
3. Open the exported gltf files in Blender and export them as SMD files while also scaling them to the correct size:
   - Ensure you have the Source 1 Tools addon installed in Blender.
4. Run `porter.py` to start porting assets:
   ```bash
   python porter.py
   ```
5. Modify the text entries within the GUI to set the paths for your models and textures.
6. The toolkit will process the assets, converting textures to VTFs and generating QC files for models.
7. Check the output directory for the converted assets.
8. Open the generated QC files in a text editor to make any necessary adjustments before compiling the models.
9. Open Crowbar and compile the models using the QC files generated by the toolkit.
10. Investigate the compiled models in your preferred Source 1 engine environment to ensure they work as expected.

### Important Notes

- **Manual Model Adjustments**: After conversion, you must manually edit the model in Blender to scale it properly. Adjust the scale from `0.025` to `1.0` (equivalent to scaling by `39.36`).
- **Final Release Preparation**: While the toolkit automates many tasks, you should never use the generated files directly in a final release. Tinker with your models to set surface properties, animations, textures, and other details.
